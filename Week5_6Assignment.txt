Be sure to include comments with the code you write for each of these!

(1) Write a script that uses a for loop to read a series of integers from the command line. The script should both (a) count the number of values less than 10 and (b) add all the numbers together. Both values should be printed to the screen.

#!/bin/bash

sum=0
for ((i=1;i<10;i++))
do ((sum += i))
	echo $i
	echo $sum
done

# DB: This is the right idea, but in this case, you're always summing the integers 1-10
#     no matter what is provided on the command line. Could loop over command-line
#     arguments with something like:
#     for num in $@
#     Also, need to tally those less than 10.


(2) Write a script that does the same thing as (1), but reads the values from a file.
read file
cat $file | ./Week5_6Assignment.sh

# DB: Good idea, but you'll need to accept command-line arguments to make this work.
#     Would probably also be a good idea to include text to prompt for the filename.

(3) Write a script that reads in two columns of numbers from a file. The columns are separated by a tab. Have it output any lines where the first column contains a number greater than 10 and the second column contains a number less than 10. HINT: there are multiple ways to do this.
read file
cat $file | awk '{ print $1>10, $2<10 }'

# DB: I see what you're going for, but the awk syntax doesn't seem to work quite right.
