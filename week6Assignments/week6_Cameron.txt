1.Countforvalues.sh
#!/bin/bash

for (( i>=1; i<=10; sum ))
do
        echo $i
done

# DB: The first part of the for statement needs to set a starting value for i and the last
#     part needs to increment the value. But this really needs to loop over values provided
#     on the command line and then add them and test whether they're less than 10.

2. Countvalues.sh file
#!/bin/bash
#this script will loop intergers and count values
# for numbers less than 10 


if  [ $ -ls 10 ]
then
        echo numbers.txt
else
        echo "not less than 10"
fi

# DB: As is, the if statement isn't really testing anything. You'll need a variable name
#     after the $ sign. Also, this should read in the values from a file.

chmod Countvalues.sh
./Countvalues.sh numbers.txt

numbers.txt contains double to triple digit values of numbers divisible by 11 starting with 33
"not less than 10" was echoed.
